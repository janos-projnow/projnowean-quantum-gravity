Overview

This repository contains a collection of PQG‑driven scripts designed to automate and streamline the processing of gravitational‑wave events from the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC). The goal is to provide a clean, reproducible, and modular pipeline for downloading, organizing, and analyzing public GW event data using established open‑science tools.
What This Project Does

The scripts included here wrap common GWTC workflows—data retrieval, preprocessing, parameter extraction, and basic diagnostic plotting—into a consistent and easy‑to‑extend framework. Whether you're exploring individual events or building higher‑level analyses, the pipeline offers a lightweight starting point that stays close to the official LIGO/Virgo conventions while remaining flexible for custom research needs.
